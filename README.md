# My LaTeX template
That's a latex template for writing lecture notes. Most of code was taken from: [link to castel lec_note](https://github.com/gillescastel/lecture-notes). I want to thank to [Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev) for his setup and template his job really helped me a lot.

## Quick overview
Most of template is in `preamble.tex` all the imports, styles and commands are created. The root of the latex document is in `src/main.tex`, just copy this folder and rename for your new document.

## Recommended setup
I recommend to use pdflatex with `neovim`, `vimtex`, `Ultisnips` and `zathura`. You can find useful articles on this site: [castel.dev](https://castel.dev/) for the setup.
